        <p>The Rottweiler is a robust working breed of great strength descended from the mastiffs of the Roman legions.
            A gentle playmate and protector within the family circle, the Rottie observes the outside world with a
            self-assured aloofness.
            A male Rottweiler will stand anywhere from 24 to 27 muscular inches at the shoulder; females run a bit
            smaller and lighter.
            The glistening, short black coat with smart rust markings add to the picture of imposing strength.
            A thickly muscled hindquarters powers the Rottie's effortless trotting gait.
            A well-bred and properly raised Rottie will be calm and confident, courageous but not unduly aggressive.
            The aloof demeanor these world-class guardians present to outsiders belies the playfulness,
            and downright silliness, that endear Rotties to their loved ones.
            (No one told the Rottie he's not a toy breed, so he is liable plop onto your lap for a cuddle.)
            Early training and socialization will harness a Rottie's territorial instincts in a positive way.</p>

        <p>Owning a dog is not just a privilege; itâ€™s a responsibility.
            They depend on us for, at minimum, food and shelter, and deserve much more.
            When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.
        </p>

        <p>The rottweiler we have today is luckily more family oriented, but never forget where these dogs come frome.
